Custom, quantized, and persistent values
================================================================================

:Date: 2026-09
:Updated: 2026-09-07

**planned**

Objective and consolidation
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Cover three uses of values: custom structs, quantized representations, and
values retained between model calls. Persistent state is built from an explicit
mapping of model outputs back to inputs, not a separate state type system. Qwen
is the first consumer: quantized values and per-request KV values carried
between decode calls.

This page contains the structured-type contract, quantization examples,
and output-to-input state binding in one implementation sequence. The separate
structured-types and mutable-cache pages have been removed; their retained
contracts and examples are integrated here, not maintained as competing
proposals. Prepacking, prepared-object identity, persistence, and scheduling
remain owned by :ref:`l-next-steps-prepared-execution`.

:ref:`l-next-steps-quantization` and
:ref:`l-next-steps-graph-builder-quantized-tensor` remain format and authoring
design references, not independent implementation sequences. Where their
proposals conflict, this page is authoritative. Only a small closed set
of common quantized forms gets specialized proto support; the format catalogue
does not become a proto hierarchy.

The completed prepared-execution, native fast-loading, allocator, and session
executor work remains the foundation. This plan defines representations that
those facilities may consume; it does not extend their cache format, rebuild
their schedulers, or reopen their completed implementation sequences.
:ref:`l-next-steps-proto-inheritance` is independent and is not a prerequisite.

Existing foundations and missing integration
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The implementation already supplies ordinary ``Tensor`` storage owners,
borrowed views and allocation handles in
``onnx_core/runtime/memory/simple_tensor.h``.

Prepared execution already owns prepared-object identity, publication,
residency, eviction and persistence. Those are separate reusable facilities,
not a graph-visible structured value system. The proposed ``StructTypeProto``
and ``EncodedValueProto`` are not existing serialized contracts.
``RuntimeContext::Clear`` clears invocation values; it must not become the
owner of persistent request state.

The new work connects typed representations to kernel consumers, then adds a
small wrapper for feeding retained outputs into the next model call.

Three independent decisions
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Keep logical meaning, physical representation and lifetime independent:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 22 38 40

   * - Axis
     - Examples
     - Contract
   * - Logical meaning
     - Dense tensor, affine quantization, codebook quantization, custom value
     - Describes what a consumer computes, including decoded type and shape
       when the value denotes a tensor.
   * - Physical representation
     - Dense bytes, blocked INT4 with scales, tiled FP32, custom records
     - Describes exact fields, buffers, bit layout, padding and format
       identity; it is not inferred from logical dtype alone.
   * - Lifetime and access
     - Immutable session value, retained request cache, invocation workspace
     - Determines ownership, sharing, synchronization and release, not the
       numerical type.

A quantized value can use either a conventional block layout or a custom
structure. A compiled representation can be quantized or floating point.
A retained input can contain a dense tensor or a structured value.
No inheritance chain can express these three independent choices cleanly.

Representation model: a small quantized core plus generic structs
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Use one ``StructTypeProto`` to describe structs, including structs containing
tensors, nested structs and sequences. Use ``EncodedValueProto`` for their
byte-encoded representations when a fixed physical layout exists, alongside
the small set of built-in layouts. A runtime struct does not need a second
type category called a composite. Quantized, kernel-specific and mutable are
not separate storage categories. Names and wire field numbers are finalized in
PR01; no ONNX-standard status is implied.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 25 75

   * - Descriptor
     - Responsibility
   * - ``StructTypeProto``
     - Describes fields and their types, nested structs, arrays and bit
       packing. A struct need not have a fixed physical size. The subset with
       statically sized inline fields also describes one byte-encoded
       element; only this subset uses checked size arithmetic and record
       counts derived from payload length.
   * - ``EncodedValueProto``
     - One value container with optional logical tensor type/shape, a layout
       choice and owned or external payload with a known byte extent.
       Layout is either a small built-in dense/affine form or a concrete
       ``StructTypeProto`` reference whose physical element size is known.
       A general struct with dynamic fields cannot be dumped into this byte
       payload. INT8 and blockwise INT4 are configurations, not distinct messages.
   * - Optional preparation metadata
     - Records source dependencies, preparation recipe and compatibility
       requirements for a derived value. These are metadata on the same
       container, not a second container owning another payload.

``EncodedValueProto`` replaces the separate ``StructProto``,
``QuantizedTensorProto`` and ``CompiledTensorProto`` value-container proposals;
it is not an additional wrapper around all three. Existing ordinary
``TensorProto`` values remain supported without migration. A common runtime
view adapts both existing tensors and encoded values, reusing allocation,
shape and external-data machinery.

``Encoded`` identifies a representation that needs a layout-aware
interpretation, rather than merely indicating that bytes are stored.
``Value`` permits custom records as well as logical tensors. A runtime struct
instance groups independently owned buffers through its fields, using the
same ``StructTypeProto`` rather than a parallel descriptor system. Those
buffers are not inline pointers in a serialized physical record.
The name applies equally to packed weights and KV blocks;
it does not imply immutability or disk persistence.

Keep the name ``EncodedValueProto`` for every value example and proposed
API. ``StructProto`` would suggest that every value must instantiate a
``StructTypeProto``, whereas built-in layouts need not do so. Reserve
``StructTypeProto`` for the reusable struct description, including its field
types and constants. Do not introduce a ``StructProto`` alias, base
class, nested value wrapper or parallel value category.

The affine layout parameters are a small nested descriptor, not a growing
``QuantizationDescriptorProto`` hierarchy. Source INT4 weights, a
kernel-specific INT4 form, and an INT4 KV block use the same container with
different layouts and lifetime bindings. Authoritative request state is not a
reconstructible weight cache.

The initial specialized subset is a proposal to freeze in PR01, not permission
to add all formats expressible by the catalogue. Additional built-in forms
require demonstrated common use and an explicit proto-size review.

The representation supports three cases:

1. **Common quantization:** INT8 per-tensor/per-axis and INT4 blockwise affine
   values select the common container's built-in affine layout.
2. **Other quantized formats:** codebooks, non-linear quantization, sparse
   outliers, mixed-bit blocks, rotations, and vendor-specific layouts use
   its structured layout plus a versioned format identity and an explicit decoder
   or registered consumer. Their schemas and numerical implementations live
   outside the proto library; adding one must not grow its message set.
3. **Fully custom structures:** arbitrary records use the same generic
   structure mechanism, with or without tensor semantics. An authoritative
   custom graph input without a consumer or decoder fails explicitly.

For example, an INT4 matrix representation can contain an array of records
``{codes, scale, zero_point, compensation, padding}``. This custom packed
layout selects a ``StructTypeProto`` rather than adding a tile-specific quantized
message. Its registered format defines the logical block mapping and field
interpretation. An FP32 packed matrix also uses structures, without inventing
a quantization descriptor for non-quantized data.

A registered native C++ type can bind a descriptor to a typed view or create
an owned runtime object with auxiliary indexes. Serialized bytes are not a
dump of that C++ object: no pointers, vtables, native padding or process-local
handles go on the wire. Endianness, alignment, field offsets and destructors
remain explicit. Zero-copy typed access is allowed only when alignment,
lifetime and layout compatibility are proved.

Keep per-weight scales and zero points in value storage, not in the reusable
type catalogue. Only true format constants belong to the type. Registered
validation and decoding are explicit operations; merely loading a descriptor
must not execute arbitrary decoder code.

The examples below distinguish parameters stored
as constants in the type from parameters stored as scalar fields in each
payload. Outside the byte buffer does not mean outside the type: constant
scale and zero point are serialized once in the shared ``StructTypeProto``
declaration, while each value stores only codes. The decoder combines those
codes with the type's constants to expose a logical FLOAT tensor. All values
of that type share the same parameters; varying them without changing the
type requires the per-value payload form.

Struct types and byte-encodable layouts
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

``StructTypeProto`` describes a struct's fields and types. A concrete
declaration selects ``array``, ``bit_packing`` or ``structure``. Each field
selects either a value type or a tensor constant in the declaration.
It may describe a cache with tensor and sequence fields, not just a packed
numeric record.

Fixed physical size is an eligibility condition for byte encoding, not a
requirement on every struct. The following wire sketch shows the struct type
and the byte-encoded value container; PR01 freezes field numbers:

.. code-block:: text

    message EncodedValueProto {
        oneof layout {
            StructTypeProto struct_type = <N>;  // exact reference or inline type
            // The small built-in layout alternatives are omitted here.
        }
        optional TypeProto logical_type = <N>;
        bytes raw_data = <N>;
        repeated StringStringEntryProto external_data = <N>;
        string name = <N>;
        string doc_string = <N>;
        // Optional preparation metadata is described below.
    }

    message StructTypeProto {
        message Structure {
            message Field {
                string name = 1;
                oneof content {
                    TypeProto type = 2;
                    TensorProto constant = 4;
                }
                string doc_string = 3;
            }
            repeated Field field = 1;
        }
        message BitPacking {
            message Component {
                string name = 1;
                uint32 bit_width = 2;
            }
            repeated Component component = 1;
            uint64 dimension = 2;
        }
        message Array {
            TypeProto element_type = 1;
            uint64 dimension = 2;
        }
        oneof kind {
            Array array = 1;
            Structure structure = 2;
            BitPacking bit_packing = 3;
            uint64 type_ref = 5;
        }
        optional FunctionProto decoder = 6;
        optional FunctionProto encoder = 7;
        string name = 8;
        string doc_string = 9;
        repeated StringStringEntryProto metadata_props = 10;
        optional uint64 type_id = 11;
    }

    message TypeProto {
        oneof value {
            // Existing alternatives remain unchanged.
            StructTypeProto struct_type = <N>;
        }
    }

    message ModelProto {
        repeated StructTypeProto struct_types = <N>;
    }

``EncodedValueProto.struct_type`` selects an exact ``type_ref`` or a concrete
inline declaration eligible for byte encoding. An exact type reference may
also appear inside ``TypeProto`` and nested fields, including references to
structs with dynamic fields. A ``StructTypeProto`` with its kind
unset is an unconstrained struct category, permitted only inside ``TypeProto``
for heterogeneous sequence/map element constraints, never as a payload layout.
Reference and category forms carry no declaration ID, decoder, encoder, name,
or declaration metadata of their own.

``Field.type`` and ``Array.element_type`` use ``TypeProto``: tensors, nested
structs, sequences, maps and optional values use their existing type
alternatives and validation rules. Tensor dimensions may be dynamic when
the consuming contract permits it. Array lengths and bit-packing counts
remain explicit concrete integers; a dynamic-length collection uses a sequence.
Opaque fields require an explicit supported native binding and lifecycle.

For byte encoding, every non-constant field must instead resolve recursively
to fixed-size inline data. Dynamic dimensions, sequences, maps, optional
values and opaque objects have no implicit inline size. Such a struct remains
a valid runtime type but cannot select the raw/external byte-payload layout.
Its runtime field values retain their ordinary owners and checked views.
There is no second composite type or descriptor to define; see
:ref:`l-next-steps-persistent-struct-state`.

``Field.constant`` is the actual ``TensorProto`` value, not a graph input or
a second value buffer. It must have concrete dimensions and matching data.
Only true shared format constants belong here; changing a constant changes
the type identity. Mutable lengths, positions and per-block quantization
parameters are instance data, not declaration constants.

Byte-encoding rules and validation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For a byte-encodable struct, compute sizes recursively in bits with checked
``uint64`` arithmetic:

.. code-block:: text

    size(scalar(T))             = bit_width(T)
    size(tensor(T, dims))       = checked_product(dims) * bit_width(T)
    size(Array(T, n))           = n * size(T)
    size(BitPacking(c..., n))   = n * sum(c.bit_width)
    size(Field(constant))       = 0
    size(Field(T))              = size(T)
    size(Structure(f...))       = sum(size(f))
    size(type_ref=id)           = size(resolve_type_id(id))

Arrays and bit packings are tight, fields follow declaration order, and
padding is explicit. Bits run from least to most significant within a byte;
multi-byte values are little-endian. Only fixed-width ONNX scalar leaves are
physical data. No native alignment or process-local pointer representation is
implicit in this contract. Every field, array and bit-packing read is
bounds-checked; a typed view does not bypass alignment or byte-extent checks.

Type checking rejects duplicate field/component names, fields with both or
neither content alternatives, invalid field types/constants, zero component
widths, unresolved or cyclic references, and invalid array/bit-packing counts.
Byte-encoding validation additionally rejects fields without a fixed physical
size, unsupported physical leaves and overflowing size arithmetic. The encoded
root must have strictly positive size divisible by eight. Constant-only
structs are valid types but cannot be roots of this byte encoding; nested
constant-only groups may contribute zero bytes. Payload divisibility and
external bounds follow the next section.

For encoded values, only the decoder or encoder of the concrete root is invoked.
A nested ``type_ref`` contributes layout and constants; its decoder or encoder
is not composed implicitly. Loading a type must not execute decoder code.

One element type, many payload lengths
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In the byte-encodable subset, ``StructTypeProto`` defines one encoded element,
which can itself be a fixed-size block. ``EncodedValueProto`` stores a flat
sequence of such elements. The payload byte length and the resolved element byte size
determine the number of records; a different count does not instantiate or
create a new type. No physical shape or redundant record count is serialized.

For example, the shared catalogue contains one block declaration:

.. code-block:: text

    StructTypeProto {                 // declaration in ModelProto.struct_types
        type_id: 2001
        name: "Int4Block"
        structure: {
            codes: INT4[32]
            scale: FLOAT
        }
    }

    EncodedValueProto {
        struct_type: { type_ref: 2001 }
        logical_type: FLOAT[4096]
        raw_data: ...                 // 128 * 20 = 2560 bytes
    }

    EncodedValueProto {
        struct_type: { type_ref: 2001 }
        logical_type: FLOAT[8192]
        raw_data: ...                 // 256 * 20 = 5120 bytes
    }

This is descriptive syntax, not the final wire schema. Each physical element
contains 16 bytes of INT4 codes followed by one 4-byte FLOAT scale, with no
implicit padding. The registered decoder defines the signed-code scaling and
mapping from blocks to logical elements. Scale values differ between blocks
and remain in the payload; the declaration only specifies their placement.

There are three distinct quantities:

* **element type:** the fixed physical layout of one ``Int4Block``;
* **payload byte length:** the extent of the flat sequence of blocks, from
  which their count is derived;
* **logical shape:** the dimensions exposed by the decoder or consuming
  kernel, not the number of physical records.

For the structured branch, require:

.. code-block:: text

    element_bytes = checked_size(resolved_struct_type)
    payload_bytes = raw_data.size()        // inline payload
    // Or external_data.length for a validated external payload extent.
    require(element_bytes > 0)
    require(payload_bytes % element_bytes == 0)
    element_count = payload_bytes / element_bytes

The concrete root element must have a strictly positive, byte-aligned size;
explicit padding is part of its type. Validate its fixed dimensions and size
arithmetic before allocation or access. The two buffers above therefore
contain ``2560 / 20 = 128`` and ``5120 / 20 = 256`` records of the same type.
An empty payload means zero records; exactly one element's byte size means
one record. Reject partial records rather than rounding their count.

Reject a zero-sized encoded root because its payload length cannot determine
its number of instances. Zero-sized nested structures, such as constant-only
field groups, remain allowed within a positive-sized root.

Inline length is already carried by ``raw_data``. External data must provide
an explicit length and a valid backing-file extent; do not infer the length
from the remainder of a file or accept conflicting payload sources.
Do not add a second serialized byte-count field.

The first version stores records densely in buffer order.
Layouts requiring internal strides, tile padding or multiple fields express
them in the fixed element structure or a supported built-in layout, not in
an implicit reshape. Built-in dense/affine layouts have their own explicit
size rules, including parameter storage; do not apply the struct formula
blindly to them.

Logical dimensions remain optional value information checked by the
format/decoder contract against the derived record count. A byte length does
not determine tensor rank or shape. Logical dimensions never make a
tensor-only operator accept encoded bytes implicitly.

Quantization examples: constants and per-value parameters
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The following descriptive notation abbreviates ordinary ONNX tensor types as
``tensor(FLOAT, [])`` and tensor constants as ``tensor(FLOAT, [], 0.25)``.
These are explanatory helpers, not additional messages or protobuf syntax.

.. code-block:: text

    ModelProto {
        struct_types: {
            type_id: 1003
            name: "LINEAR_INT4_128_FIXED_PARAMETERS"
            structure: {
                field: {name: "values", type: array(INT4, dimension=128)}
                field: {name: "scale", constant: tensor(FLOAT, [], 0.25)}
                field: {name: "zero_point", constant: tensor(INT64, [], -2)}

            structure: {
                field: {name: "values", type: array(INT4, dimension=128)}
                field: {name: "scale", type: tensor(FLOAT, [])}
                field: {name: "zero_point", type: tensor(INT64, [])}
            }
            decoder: DecodeLinearInt4
        }
    }

    EncodedValueProto {
        struct_type: {type_ref: 1003}
        logical_type: FLOAT[128]
        raw_data: <64 code bytes for weight_a>
    }
    EncodedValueProto {
        struct_type: {type_ref: 1003}
        logical_type: FLOAT[128]
        raw_data: <64 code bytes for weight_b>
    }
    EncodedValueProto {
        struct_type: {type_ref: 1002}
        logical_type: FLOAT[128]

    }

        logical_type: FLOAT[128]
        raw_data: <64 code bytes, FLOAT scale=0.25, INT64 zero_point=-2>
    }

For type 1003, both constants are serialized once at
``ModelProto.struct_types[*].structure.field[*].constant``. Neither value
buffer contains them; there are no separate graph inputs for these parameters.
Each payload is exactly ``128 * 4 / 8 = 64`` bytes, and decoding applies
``(code - (-2)) * 0.25``. Changing the constants requires a different type ID.

For type 1002, both payloads occupy ``64 + 4 + 8 = 76`` bytes. The decoder
reads each value's parameters and applies ``(code - zero_point) * scale``.
Changing those values does not change the layout or type ID. The INT64 at
byte offset 68 is not necessarily aligned; typed readers must handle it.
Outside the byte buffer means inside the shared type declaration only for
true format constants, not arbitrary per-value state.

Codebook quantization through a shared subtype
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

A subtype describes 32 two-bit indices and a constant four-entry codebook.
A parent embeds that subtype by stable ID and adds a per-block FLOAT scale.
This is composition by reference in the type catalogue, not inheritance or
a pointer to another value: each parent payload contains its own code bytes.

    }

    EncodedValueProto {
        struct_type: {type_ref: 1102}
        logical_type: FLOAT[32]

        logical_type: FLOAT[4096]
        raw_data: <128 records, each containing 8 code bytes and one FLOAT scale>
    }

Hexadecimal payload notation is illustrative, not a literal string. ``E4``
packs indices ``0, 1, 2, 3`` in least-significant-bit order; ``00 00 00 40``
encodes FLOAT 2.0. The codebook lives once in type 1101's constant field and
contributes no payload bytes.

Resolution follows ``1102 -> quantized.type -> 1101``. The root decoder reads
the subtype's codebook and each record's scale and indices:

.. code-block:: text

    table = resolved_type(1101).structure.field["codebook"].constant
    output[block * 32 + i] = record.scale * table[record.quantized.codes[i].index]

This is descriptive field-view notation. The decoder uses resolved types,
not model catalogue positions; it does not invoke a subtype decoder.
The first value decodes to ``[-2.0, -0.5, 0.5, 2.0]`` repeated eight times.
The second flattens 128 decoded blocks in storage order.

Type 1101 contributes eight bytes; type 1102 contributes ``8 + 4 = 12`` bytes
per record. Payload lengths 12 and 1536 imply one and 128 records without
serialized counts or physical shapes. Exactly four FLOAT codebook entries
make all two-bit indices valid.

Other parent types may reuse subtype 1101. Changing its constant codebook
requires a new subtype ID and a new parent ID when the reference changes.
Codes, per-block scales and payload lengths may change without new types.

Proto-library size gate
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

PR01 records the existing minimal proto-library binary size, dependencies and
exported symbols with one reproducible Release configuration, and fixes the
allowed size increase before implementation. PR02 reports the delta under
identical compiler, linker, stripping and build settings.

The proto target contains only the selected compact messages, serialization
and structural machinery. Format-specific validators, decoders, catalogue data
and registration tables belong to optional compute/runtime components, not
transitive dependencies of the proto library.

A codebook or mixed-bit fixture must round-trip through structures without
adding a specialized proto message, parser branch or enum entry for its
format. Existing ONNX scalar types are reused rather than duplicated.
Exceeding the agreed binary-size budget requires reducing the built-in
subset or an explicit design decision, not silently increasing the budget.

Interoperability with prepared execution
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

``EncodedValueProto`` may describe the bytes and logical view of an object
managed by :ref:`l-next-steps-prepared-execution`. This plan does not define
prepack requests, prepared keys, source identities, cache persistence,
compatibility checks, publication, eviction, or scheduling. Those contracts
remain entirely in :ref:`l-next-steps-prepared-execution`,
:ref:`l-next-steps-model-resolution`, and
:ref:`l-next-steps-native-fast-loading-completion`.

The representation layer exposes only enough validated type, layout, and
payload information for a prepared consumer to bind a typed view. It does not
add preparation provenance to ``EncodedValueProto`` or a ``prepared_values``
field to ``ModelProto``. Portable source retention and persisted compiled
payloads remain concerns of the prepared-object cache.

.. _l-next-steps-mutable-cache:

Persistent state from model inputs and outputs
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

State is simply the model outputs retained to supply some inputs of the next
call. The model already describes their types; the caller supplies only the
output-to-input mapping and the initial values. Matching names or shapes is
not enough to infer which output is meant to feed which input.

.. code-block:: text

    model inputs:  tokens, past_key, past_value
    model outputs: logits, present_key, present_value

    state = make_state(
        model,
        feedback={
            "past_key": "present_key",       // input <- output
            "past_value": "present_value"
        },
        initial={"past_key": empty_key, "past_value": empty_value}
    )

    out = state.run({"tokens": first_tokens})
    out = state.run({"tokens": next_tokens})

This proposed helper is equivalent to the ordinary stateless loop:

.. code-block:: text

    feeds = {"tokens": tokens, **state.values}
    outputs = run(model, feeds)
    state.values = {
        input_name: outputs[output_name]
        for input_name, output_name in feedback.items()
    }

The retained values constitute the state. There is no separately authored
``state_spec``, hidden kernel state or new persistent proto. ``make_state``
derives field types from the selected model inputs and checks that the
corresponding outputs can feed them. Initial contents and unresolved dimensions
must be supplied; types alone cannot determine an initial cache.

.. _l-next-steps-persistent-composite-state:
.. _l-next-steps-persistent-struct-state:

A struct with only one persistent part
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The same mapping can select a field instead of an entire input. These are
ordinary structs described by ``StructTypeProto``:

.. code-block:: text

    Cache = struct {
        keys: Tensor
        values: Tensor
        length: INT64
    }

    model input request: struct {
        tokens: INT64[batch, sequence]
        cache: Cache
    }
    model output response: struct {
        logits: FLOAT[batch, sequence, vocabulary]
        cache: Cache
    }

    state = make_state(
        model,
        feedback={"request.cache": "response.cache"},
        initial={"request.cache": initial_cache}
    )
    out = state.run({"request.tokens": first_tokens})
    out = state.run({"request.tokens": next_tokens})

Only ``request.cache`` persists. Tokens are supplied anew and logits are not
retained by the state. To retain a smaller part, select its field path instead.
The struct declaration contains no ``persistent`` flag: the feedback mapping
selects the persistent part of this instance.

Dotted paths are shorthand for a graph input/output name followed by struct
field names, not additional model inputs. The helper assembles the input struct
from current feeds and retained fields. The actual tensor types and shape
constraints come from the model; ``Tensor`` above only abbreviates them.

Minimal rules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Every selected input/output path must exist and have compatible types,
  representation contracts and shape constraints. Dynamic dimensions are
  checked on the actual values before they become next-call inputs.
* Every required input field comes from either the current feeds or retained
  state. Missing initial values, duplicate assignments and overlapping
  destination paths are errors.
* Update all retained fields only after successful execution and validation.
  Two states are independent; simultaneous calls using the same state are rejected.
* ``reset(initial)`` restores caller-supplied initial values; ``close`` releases
  retained values. Neither action may race with an active call.

Persistence does not imply mutation, a packed byte layout or disk persistence.
The first implementation preserves ordinary model input/output semantics.
In-place KV reuse is a later optimization when the kernel and ownership permit
it; it must not modify previously returned ordinary outputs. If such an
optimization fails after modifying state, reset is required before reuse.
Snapshots, a new alias-annotation wire format and region-level mutation
scheduling are outside this initial design.

Quantized and paged caches use the same feedback
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

A cache can contain a sequence of blocks instead of contiguous K/V tensors.
This changes its fields and representations, not its persistence mechanism:

.. code-block:: text

    Cache = struct {
        blocks: sequence<KVBlock>
        length: INT64
    }
    feedback = {"request.cache": "response.cache"}

Each K/V block may use a different ``EncodedValueProto`` layout, such as
INT4, INT8 or a codebook struct, provided its decoded type and geometry satisfy
the consumer contract. The block's logical token range and valid length are
value data; payload byte length measures physical records, not valid tokens.
Changing scales requires a defined conversion of the affected codes.

Paging, block conversion and zero-copy Attention are optional consumer
optimizations after basic input/output feedback works. They must not require
another state description. Their later acceptance measures bounded workspace,
per-block allocation/conversion and no full-cache copy or dequantization;
they are not prerequisites for constructing persistent state.

GraphBuilder, shape inference and serialization
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

``ShapesContext`` stays the single source of truth for symbolic value types.
Extend it with ``StructTypeProto`` field types and, where applicable, the
byte-encoded layout and optional logical view;
do not add an independent quantization registry in ``GraphBuilder``.
Known logical dimensions do not permit a tensor-only operator to consume
structured bytes implicitly: use an explicit decoder or a matching schema.

``GraphBuilder`` preserves structured source initializers, type references,
byte extents, external payload ownership and quantization metadata
through import/export, functions and subgraphs. Deduplication considers
semantic profiles as well as payload bytes, layout and optional logical shapes.
Feedback bindings are validated against the final model inputs/outputs; a
rewrite that removes or changes a selected path requires an updated mapping,
not a silently retained hidden state.

General struct declarations and their tensor/sequence field constraints
round-trip through the type catalogue as well. This does not make a runtime
cache instance a serializable initializer: the byte-payload encoding remains
limited to eligible fixed-layout structs. Unsupported field-value export
fails explicitly rather than dropping dynamic fields or serializing pointers.

Do not make the core plan depend on modifying upstream ONNX wire messages or
on proto inheritance. If model extensions are later serialized, document their
version and round-trip behavior explicitly; standard ONNX export must lower to
supported tensors/operators or report an unsupported export, never silently
drop authoritative structured values or feedback bindings.

Implementation sequence
+++++++++++++++++++++++

All new steps are pending; completed foundations above are reused.

The first concrete implementation is the **structured representation**:
``StructTypeProto`` and the structured-layout branch of ``EncodedValueProto``.
PR01 first freezes their minimal contract and the proto-size budget. PR02
implements checked typed/constant fields, arrays, bit packing, type references,
and runtime field views using the same declarations. It implements payload
ownership, byte extents, derived record counts and value serialization for the
byte-encodable subset before adding the small built-in affine subset.
Custom packed weights and heterogeneous KV-block fixtures must work through
structures without requiring a catalogue of native quantized types.

The struct types, physical layouts, examples and state bindings above belong to
this single sequence. Graph integration and persistent-state consumers build
on the same representation foundation, without a second cache or struct
roadmap.

does not block PR07.

Ownership and acceptance
++++++++++++++++++++++++

``onnx-light`` owns the type/serialization contracts, allocation and lifecycle,
graph/schema integration, effect scheduling and input/output feedback state.
``onnx-light-cpu`` supplies its format validators, typed consumers, KV append
and Attention implementation. It does not create another persistent-state
manager or private executor.

Acceptance uses C++ fixtures and existing runtime/backend test infrastructure.
Compare encoded versus decoded computation and the state helper versus a manual
output-to-input loop with the same numerical contract. Test changed scales with
unchanged code bytes, missing consumers, reset, invalid capacities, failed
mutations and independent requests.

State fixtures retain a whole tensor and only the cache field of a larger
struct. Verify that tokens/logits are not retained, types come from model I/O,
the next call receives exactly the previous selected outputs, and missing,
overlapping or incompatible bindings fail explicitly. Test failed calls
without partial state updates and two independent feedback loops.
Dynamic fields remain valid struct types but cannot be encoded as fixed-size
inline payload fields. Optional reuse must not corrupt retained ordinary outputs.

Type/value tests also round-trip two encoded values with the same stable type
ID but different payload lengths and derived record counts. Include two models
with reordered catalogues and unchanged references, per-value scale/zero-point parameters,
missing and duplicate IDs, and conflicting definitions under the same ID.
Round-trip constants inside the shared type declaration without including
them in value-buffer sizes. Reject fields with both or neither of ``type``
and ``constant`` and invalid tensor constants. Reject unknown-size fields only
when validating eligibility for the byte-payload layout, not when declaring a
general struct type.
Verify a single shared resolved descriptor, one-record and empty payloads,
zero-sized-root rejection, allowed constant-only nested structures, partial
records, arithmetic overflow, explicit external lengths and validated extents,
logical shapes inconsistent with derived record counts, and
session-to-model catalogue resolution preserving IDs without copying type
declarations per KV block.

The basic state helper promises correct feedback, not zero-copy execution.
Only a demonstrated fixed-capacity reuse path may claim no full-cache
allocation or copy.
Publish latency, dispersion, peak/resident bytes and copy/read counters;
performance claims must distinguish decoding, inference and state-management
cost.
