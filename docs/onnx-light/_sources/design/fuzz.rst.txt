Fuzzing
=======

`onnx-light` ships a set of `atheris
<https://github.com/google/atheris>`_-based Python fuzz targets that
exercise the public API surface from random / malformed inputs.
They live in :mod:`onnx_light.fuzz` and are intended to be driven by
`OSS-Fuzz <https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz>`_ for long-running
coverage-guided campaigns, while a short smoke campaign is also run
in CI to catch regressions in the harnesses themselves.

The harnesses are ported from the upstream ONNX harnesses introduced
in `onnx/onnx#8052 <https://github.com/onnx/onnx/pull/8052>`_ and
adapted to the slightly smaller surface exposed by `onnx-light`.

Differences from upstream ONNX harnesses
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

`onnx-light` exposes a slightly smaller surface than `onnx`:

* ``onnx_light.checker.check_model`` takes a ``ModelProto`` only (no raw
  bytes overload, no ``full_check`` flag). The checker harness therefore
  loads first and then checks.
* ``onnx_light.shape_inference.infer_shapes(model)`` does not accept
  ``strict_mode`` / ``check_type`` kwargs. The shape-inference harness
  still consumes a toggle byte to switch between the raw-bytes path and
  the structured-model path; the unused toggle bits are reserved for
  future use.
* ``onnx_light.onnx.load(bytes)`` replaces ``onnx.load_model_from_string``.

How OSS-Fuzz uses these files
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The companion OSS-Fuzz infrastructure clones this repository and runs
each ``fuzz_*.py`` file via ``compile_python_fuzzer``. The ``build.sh``
in that repo should reference these files from
``$SRC/onnx-light/onnx_light/fuzz/``.

Running a harness locally
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

Atheris requires a libFuzzer-instrumented Python build; the easiest way
is via the OSS-Fuzz Docker image. For quick local smoke-tests:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install atheris
    python -m onnx_light.fuzz.fuzz_checker -runs=1000
    python -m onnx_light.fuzz.fuzz_parser -runs=1000
    python -m onnx_light.fuzz.fuzz_shape_inference -runs=1000
    python -m onnx_light.fuzz.fuzz_optim_shape_inference -runs=1000
    python -m onnx_light.fuzz.fuzz_version_converter -runs=1000

To generate the seed corpora that OSS-Fuzz uses as starting inputs:

.. code-block:: bash

    python -m onnx_light.fuzz.make_seed_corpus /tmp/vc_seeds.zip /tmp/parser_seeds.zip

Continuous fuzzing in CI
++++++++++++++++++++++++

The ``.github/workflows/fuzz.yml`` workflow runs a short smoke campaign
(``-runs=2000`` per harness) on a weekly schedule (Mondays at 06:00
UTC), on manual ``workflow_dispatch``, and on pull requests that touch
``onnx_light/fuzz/**``. It is meant to catch regressions in the
harnesses themselves and obvious shallow bugs; long-running
coverage-guided campaigns are still expected to be driven by OSS-Fuzz.

Design notes
++++++++++++

Why ``except Exception: return``?
---------------------------------

Fuzz targets must never crash on expected errors — only on *unexpected*
ones (memory corruption, hangs, sanitizer reports). All protobuf parse
failures, ``ValidationError``, ``InferenceError``, ``ConvertError``,
etc. are expected when the fuzzer feeds random bytes. Swallowing them
lets libFuzzer keep searching for inputs that cause real bugs.

Why ``TestOneInput``?
---------------------

``TestOneInput`` is the `required entry-point name
<https://github.com/google/atheris#usage>`_ for atheris harnesses.

``fuzz_shape_inference.py`` toggle byte
---------------------------------------

The shape inference harness exercises two code paths per iteration,
selected by the last byte of the input:

.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1
    :widths: 20 80

    * - Bit
      - Meaning
    * - ``0x04``
      - Use structured model builder (If/Loop/Scan subgraphs) instead
        of raw bytes

The remaining bits are reserved for future toggles. This lets a single
harness cover both the protobuf-parser path and the recursive subgraph
visitor without needing separate fuzzers.

Recursion limit in ``fuzz_shape_inference.py``
----------------------------------------------

``sys.setrecursionlimit(1000)`` keeps a single deeply-nested input from
crashing the fuzzer process on every iteration, so libFuzzer can
continue finding unrelated bugs.

Adding a new harness
++++++++++++++++++++

1. Create ``onnx_light/fuzz/fuzz_<name>.py`` following the pattern of
   an existing harness.
2. If the fuzzer benefits from seed inputs, add them to
   ``make_seed_corpus.py`` and wire up the output zip in the OSS-Fuzz
   ``build.sh``.
3. Open a PR here; once merged, update the OSS-Fuzz ``build.sh`` if a
   new seed zip was added.
