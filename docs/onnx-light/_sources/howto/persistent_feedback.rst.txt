Persistent input/output feedback
===============================

Feedback state retains selected model outputs as inputs for the next call.
The graph declares the relationship in ``GraphProto.persistent_bindings``;
types come from its final input/output declarations. The caller supplies
initial values, not a separate feedback mapping. Execution uses the existing
session and allocator infrastructure, not a separate executor.

Each bound input must have **exactly one value-use** in the graph. Every node
input position counts, including read-only operations such as ``Shape`` and
two positions of the same node. A graph output that directly returns that input
also counts, as do captures in nested graph attributes. The check counts
references statically, including references in mutually exclusive branches.
Input declarations, bindings and ``value_info`` metadata do not count as uses.
Both ONNX validation and runtime graph-plan construction enforce this rule;
graphs without persistent bindings retain their ordinary sharing semantics.

The native :cpp:class:`onnx_light::core::runtime::PersistentValueState` uses the
existing runtime execution and value ownership contracts. Create one state
per independent request. Python initialization/reset, C++ ownership transfer,
state forwarding and state-value access retain buffer owners without copying payloads.
Shapes, metadata and owner handles may be copied. Kernels can allocate new
computed results; the state layer does not duplicate those results merely
to retain or return them. The CPU Attention append optimization described
below reduces kernel allocations and prefix copies independently of this
zero-copy state forwarding.

.. warning::

   Inputs, retained state and returned views can share the same payload.
   Callers and kernels must not modify that payload while shared or retained.
   ``state.values`` is a shared view, not an independently mutable snapshot.
   Metadata such as a returned tensor's name and shape is independent.

The model is immutable for the entire bound session lifetime. State creation
and execution do not serialize, clone or hash the model to check for changes.
To rewrite the graph, create a new state/session after rewriting instead.

A basic feedback loop
---------------------

The Python binding is available from the native runtime module:

.. code-block:: python

    import numpy
    from onnx_light.onnx_lib import parser
    from onnx_light.onnx_py._onnxpykernels import runtime

    model = parser.parse_model(
        '<ir_version: 10, opset_import: ["" : 18]>'
        "accumulate (float[2] delta, float[2] past) => (float[2] present)"
        "{ present = Add(delta, past) }"
    )
    binding = model.graph.persistent_bindings.add()
    binding.input_name = "past"
    binding.output_name = "present"
    context = runtime.RuntimeContext(
        runtime.KernelContext(runtime.default_opset(18))
    )
    initial = numpy.zeros(2, dtype=numpy.float32)
    state = runtime.PersistentValueState(model, initial={"past": initial})
    delta = numpy.ones(2, dtype=numpy.float32)
    first = state.run(context, {"delta": delta})
    second = state.run(context, {"delta": delta})
    numpy.testing.assert_array_equal(
        numpy.from_dlpack(second["present"]),
        [2, 2],
    )
    state.reset({"past": initial})
    state.close()

The mapping is **whole input destination to whole output source**. An input
is entirely persistent or entirely supplied by current feeds, never partly
both. Binding names and initial/current-feed/``state.values`` dictionary keys
are exact, literal graph names, with no path syntax or escaping.
``"request.cache"`` names the graph input literally named ``request.cache``;
it cannot select a field of ``request``. Unknown names are rejected.
Nested dictionaries represent complete structured values, not partial feeds.

Inputs accept runtime ``Tensor`` objects, contiguous CPU NumPy arrays and
compatible DLPack producers such as CPU PyTorch tensors. Noncontiguous,
byte-swapped or unsupported representations raise an error rather than
being copied. PyTorch tensors requiring gradients must be detached by the
caller before DLPack export; ``detach()`` shares storage.

Selected outputs and ``state.values`` contain tensors with retained storage owners.
They remain valid after callers drop their input references, after another
run, or after reset/close. Unsupported ownerless output storage is rejected
rather than silently copied for a selected output; an allocator cannot recycle a live retained
allocation.
The binding keeps the model alive. The supplied context configures allocators
and custom kernels; each call executes in a fresh child context, rather than
leaving old feeds or intermediate values in the caller's context.
The binding also retains supplied contexts so cached kernel allocator
references remain valid. Reuse the same context for a state's calls.
Initializers use model-backed views when their representation is directly
readable; other numeric representations and strings use normal conversion.
String tensors cannot be persistent, including nested tensor fields and string
constants in a selected whole structure or encoded layout. Catalogue references
are checked recursively. Declarations fail before state initialization, and
runtime retention rejects string payloads rather than copying them.
Ordinary nonpersistent string feeds and outputs remain supported and use normal
materialized string storage.

Persistence applies only to the declared whole outputs, not the entire context.
Nonpersistent outputs keep normal allocator and materialization behavior.
There is no alternate kernel dispatcher: for example, tensor ``Identity`` still
computes an ordinary output rather than promising to alias its input.

The corresponding C++ entry points are:

.. code-block:: cpp

    using namespace onnx_light::core::runtime;

    auto *binding = model.mutable_graph()->add_persistent_bindings();
    binding->set_input_name("past");
    binding->set_output_name("present");
    PersistentValueState state(
        model,
        {{"past", RuntimeValue(Tensor::FromFloat("past", {2}, {0.f, 0.f}))}});
    RuntimeContext context(KernelContext(18));
    auto outputs = state.Run(
        context,
        {{"delta", RuntimeValue(Tensor::FromFloat("delta", {2}, {1.f, 1.f}))}});
    state.Reset(
        {{"past", RuntimeValue(Tensor::FromFloat("past", {2}, {0.f, 0.f}))}});
    state.Close();

The C++ constructor and ``Reset`` accept initial maps by value. Build an owned
``RuntimeValueMap`` and pass ``std::move(initial)`` for zero-copy transfer.
Passing an lvalue uses ordinary C++ copy semantics. To share an existing owned
tensor explicitly, use ``std::move(tensor).RetainStorage()`` once, then
``BorrowView()`` on the returned owner-backed view. Const reads never move or
promote storage.

C++ callers register the operator kernels as usual before executing the model
(see :doc:`register_builtin_operators`). The model and configured allocators
must outlive the state/session using them. With the reference-based C++
constructor, the model must also outlive any returned views of its initializer
storage. Use the ``shared_ptr<const ModelProto>`` constructor to retain the
model automatically in such views; the Python binding retains its model
automatically.

Lifecycle and validation
------------------------

* Construct the state **after** graph rewrites. Every graph-declared input and output
  must exist in the final model, with compatible types and shape constraints.
  A removed or changed input/output needs an updated graph binding and a new state.
* Supply initial contents for every feedback destination. Each subsequent
  call supplies the remaining whole inputs; current feeds must not override
  retained inputs. Duplicate binding input names or output names are rejected.
* State advances only after successful execution and validation of the next
  values. A failed or cancelled call must not publish a partial update.
* Reset explicitly supplies new initial contents. Closing releases retained
  values. Calls, resets and closes on the same state must not overlap.
* Independent states have separate state containers. They can explicitly share
  read-only input storage; neither may mutate a shared buffer.

Publication replaces owner handles atomically after validation. Failure or
cancellation leaves the old state available; it does not require backup
copies. This guarantee does not roll back external writes that violate the
read-only contract. Persistent declarations currently belong to the root
graph; declarations inside control-flow subgraphs are rejected.

Cancellation uses the existing task-completion primitive:

.. code-block:: python

    completion = runtime.TaskCompletion()
    completion.cancel("request no longer needed")
    # state.run(context, feeds, completion) now rejects the cancelled call.

A completion is single-use. A pending completion can also be cancelled from
another thread while a call runs. Already executing kernels finish normally,
but cancellation winning the publication race prevents the state update.
Successful publication completes the token, so cancelling it afterwards is
an error. A failed call leaves the previous valid state available for retry.
Execution releases the Python GIL; use independent contexts for concurrent
requests, and do not mutate model/context configuration during a call.

Structured feedback
-------------------

A binding retains a whole input, including every dynamic field of a structured
value. To retain a cache while supplying fresh tokens, declare ``cache`` and
``tokens`` as separate graph inputs and bind ``cache`` to a whole ``next_cache``
output. The struct declaration comes from
``StructTypeProto`` in the model; persistence is a property of the feedback
declaration in ``GraphProto``, not a flag on the type or encoded payload.

This is equivalent to manually taking the selected outputs from each
stateless invocation and passing them to the next invocation. Separate unselected
outputs, such as logits, are not part of retained state. Fields inside a selected
output are all retained.

Python represents named structs as nested dictionaries. For a model declaring
structured ``cache`` and ``next_cache`` values and a separate ``tokens`` input:

.. code-block:: python

    binding = model.graph.persistent_bindings.add()
    binding.input_name = "cache"
    binding.output_name = "next_cache"
    state = runtime.PersistentValueState(model, {"cache": initial_cache})
    output = state.run(context, {"tokens": tokens})

Custom kernels use ``context.get_value(name)`` and
``context.put_value(name, value)`` to exchange structured values; ordinary
tensor kernels continue to use the existing tensor API. In C++, structured
and encoded edges live in ``RuntimeContext::values()`` as ``RuntimeValue``
objects containing existing tensors or ``EncodedValueProto`` payloads.
Inline structured encoded payloads can be retained as whole values; external
payloads must first be loaded. This API currently supports tensors, named
structs and inline structured encodings, not sequence/map/optional state.
``If`` and model-local functions forward selected whole output names and move
those results without persistence-related copies. Function attributes,
``Loop`` and ``Scan`` use their ordinary runtime implementations: their normal
computation/transport costs remain, but unrelated operators are not prohibited.

``GraphBuilder`` preserves and validates persistence declarations during
import/export and supported rewrites. Direct edits to graph input/output
names require corresponding binding edits; dangling names are rejected.
An export to standard ONNX
that cannot preserve this contract must be rejected, not silently strip
the bindings. Explicit model saving serializes the declarations, not the
current request's retained state; execution itself does not serialize them.

Contiguous CPU Attention feedback
--------------------------------

Declare ``past_key <- present_key`` and ``past_value <- present_value`` using
the ordinary graph bindings. The native CPU ``Attention`` consumer can then
retain extra allocation capacity for subsequent appends. There is no separate
cache identifier, state mapping or executor.

Internally, ``PersistentValueState`` retains ``PersistentValue`` objects, with a
``PersistentTensor`` at each tensor leaf. ``PersistentTensor`` composes an ordinary
``Tensor`` with certified allocation capacity; it does not inherit from ``Tensor``.
The runtime receives ordinary tensor views and separate, move-only ``AppendLease``
objects for eligible root bindings. Neither tensor copies nor borrowed views carry
capacity metadata or write permissions. Child function and subgraph contexts do
not inherit these permissions.

The reservation API is operator-independent:

1. A kernel calls ``RuntimeContext::ReservePersistentAppend`` with the desired
   result shape, append axis and input/output slots. The context resolves the
   exact declared binding and selects the output allocator.
2. ``PersistentTensor::AppendLease::Reserve`` handles layout eligibility,
   geometric growth and prefix relocation. It either reuses spare capacity or
   allocates a new contiguous buffer and copies only the committed prefix.
   Unsupported layouts return no reservation so the kernel can use its
   ordinary implementation. Each lease accepts only one attempt, including
   attempts declined for disabled capacity or unsupported layouts. A second
   attempt raises an error instead of allocating another buffer.
3. The kernel initializes the entire ``AppendReservation::writable_bytes()``
   span directly. There is no temporary tail tensor required by this API.
4. ``RuntimeContext::CommitPersistentAppend`` checks the declared initialized
   byte count, seals the candidate and returns an ordinary tensor view. This
   does not publish the state: ``PersistentValueState`` still validates all outputs
   and publishes them together only after successful completion.

A producer can compute new elements directly into that span. Attention instead
copies the current K/V inputs, which already exist as model inputs, straight into
the reserved region. Those copies remain necessary; the reservation API does not
add an intermediate tensor or a second copy.

This storage implementation is contiguous. A future ``PersistentPagedTensor``
would own a different allocation policy and expose page-aware writable regions;
paged storage and paged Attention kernels are not implemented here.

The reusable layout is dense rank-four ``FLOAT`` with shape
``[1, 1, valid_length, head_size]`` for each K/V tensor. Query tensors can
have multiple heads (multi-query attention). The tensor's sequence dimension
and logical byte extent describe only valid tokens, never spare capacity.
K and V may have different head sizes.
The Attention node must directly consume and produce the bound root-graph
K/V inputs and outputs. Intermediate tensors, function/control-flow transport
and unmatched input/output pairs keep ordinary kernel concatenation; they do
not acquire append permissions merely because another graph output is retained.

``RuntimeSessionOptions::persistent_tensor_initial_capacity`` selects the initial
capacity along the kernel's append axis (32 by default; tokens for Attention);
zero disables reservations. ``PersistentTensor`` grows capacity geometrically
when necessary, using the selected allocator without an alternate allocator or
automatic retry after allocation failure. This option affects ``PersistentValueState``
execution, not ordinary stateless ``RuntimeSession`` calls.

Python exposes the same option as a keyword-only constructor argument and a
read/write property on ``runtime.RuntimeSessionOptions``. It accepts a
nonnegative integer representable as C++ ``size_t``. Pass the options to
``PersistentValueState`` when constructing the state:

.. code-block:: python

    options = runtime.RuntimeSessionOptions(persistent_tensor_initial_capacity=64)
    state = runtime.PersistentValueState(model, initial, options=options)

    # Disables reservations for a separate state, without changing the first state.
    options.persistent_tensor_initial_capacity = 0
    ordinary_state = runtime.PersistentValueState(model, initial, options=options)

Options are copied at construction; changing the bundle later does not change
an existing state.

Reuse is deliberately conservative:

* Only internally created append buffers are eligible. An arbitrary borrowed
  NumPy/DLPack buffer, even one with an owner token, does not grant write access.
  Importing returned tensors or ``Values()`` views into a new state, or through
  ``Reset``, retains their bytes without copying but does not import append
  capacity. Their first append allocates a new certified buffer.
* Ownership is checked before creating invocation-local aliases. Keeping a
  previous output or ``Values()`` view alive prevents reuse of that allocation.
  The next result instead receives a fresh allocation; the old view's bytes,
  shape and lifetime do not change.
* An eligible append writes only the new token range. It does not move or
  rewrite the valid prefix. The previous state's logical extent remains
  unchanged until successful publication. Capacity is published only when the
  returned tensor still matches the kernel's candidate owner, pointer, type,
  shape and logical byte extent.
* Capacity exhaustion makes ``PersistentTensor`` allocate a larger buffer and
  copy the valid prefix once. State publication still only transfers owner
  handles.
* Multiple batches or KV heads use ordinary dense concatenation: increasing
  the sequence dimension changes the stride between heads, so prefix-preserving
  tail append is not possible in that layout. Half-precision promotion and
  other unsupported reuse paths keep their ordinary computation semantics.
* Empty prefixes and empty appended chunks contribute no copied bytes.
  Zero-width value caches use the dense fallback and keep their declared
  shapes, including the empty final dimension of the Attention output.

Cancellation is a publication gate, not kernel preemption. A failed or
cancelled invocation can have written unused tail bytes, but cannot change the
previous state's valid prefix or length. A retry must fully write its new
token range. Reset replaces the retained owners; close releases them. Existing
returned views remain readable after either operation. Use independent states
and contexts for concurrent requests; sharing retained owners disables unsafe
reuse rather than making either request mutate the other's state.

Opt-in storage auditing through runtime events
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Storage auditing uses the existing runtime event API. Set
``RuntimeContextOptions::events_enabled = true`` and read ``context.events()``.
Every context has a shared event log. With events disabled (the default),
persistence works identically but creates no storage audit events or counters
and takes no event-recording locks.
Diagnostic metadata is not copied into function or half-precision
scratch contexts on this path.

``RuntimeEventAction::kPersistentStorage`` identifies storage reports. Each
``RuntimeEvent`` directly records the work in ``storage_allocations``,
``storage_allocated_bytes``, ``storage_prefix_copied_bytes``,
``storage_append_copied_bytes`` and ``storage_reuse_count``.
Kernels and contiguous reservations use
``RuntimeContext::RecordEvent`` with action ``kPersistentStorage`` to record
this work in the existing shared log. Producing new elements directly into the
writable region does not count as copying them.

These are explicit reports, not automatic counters for every runtime
allocation or tensor copy. Attention currently reports K/V construction on
both reusable and ordinary dense paths. Other consumers can use the same
event API without adding operator-specific state to ``RuntimeContext``.

State forwarding and kernel storage construction have different costs.
Pointer identity at retention, invocation and publication boundaries verifies
that the state layer does not copy tensor payloads. Feedback invocations,
subgraphs, functions and half-precision scratch contexts share the caller's
event log. Events are visible as soon as they are recorded, including work
preceding a failure or cancellation; no forwarding or end-of-scope merge occurs.
Runtime recording serializes appends from concurrent children. Read or modify
``events()`` only when no other context is recording or clearing the log.
``ClearEvents()`` clears the shared log for all these contexts. Independently
constructed contexts keep independent logs. Allocation failures while recording
propagate to the caller, just like other runtime allocation failures.
Attention's storage reports exclude its
score/output allocations, arithmetic workspace, feed construction, or
half-precision conversion.

Sum fields from the event list when totals are needed. Call
``context.ClearEvents()`` before a run to obtain per-token reports; otherwise
events accumulate in that context, including runs of different feedback states.
Resetting or closing a state does not clear the caller's log.
``event.storage_allocated_bytes`` counts requested storage capacity,
not physical heap allocations: an I/O arena may satisfy a request from its free
lists. The existing ``event.allocated_bytes`` and ``event.peak_bytes`` fields
still describe allocator live and peak memory and have not changed meaning.
The decode example enables events explicitly, so its timing includes auditing.

For one new token with ``FLOAT`` K/V head sizes ``Dk`` and ``Dv``, appending
copies ``4 * (Dk + Dv)`` bytes. Reuse within capacity allocates no new KV
buffers and copies zero prefix bytes. Growth or an outstanding external alias
requires a new buffer for each affected K/V tensor and copies its valid prefix.
For ``B`` batches, ``H`` KV heads and a prefix of ``L`` tokens, the dense
fallback allocates two result buffers and copies
``4 * B * H * L * (Dk + Dv)`` prefix bytes, plus
``4 * B * H * (Dk + Dv)`` append bytes per token. None of these kernel-level
copies is a state-management copy.

A runnable native example, including per-token allocation/copy measurements
and a multi-head fallback, is provided in
:doc:`../examples_cc/contiguous_kv_decode_example`.
