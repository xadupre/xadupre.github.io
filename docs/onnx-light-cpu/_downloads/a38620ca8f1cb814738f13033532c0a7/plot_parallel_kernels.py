Is it worth parallelizing the kernels?
======================================

The :mod:`onnx-light-cpu` kernels are already SIMD-accelerated, but each call
runs on a single thread. This example answers a natural follow-up question:
**does spreading an array across several threads make the kernels faster?**

The Python bindings release the GIL while a kernel runs, so several threads can
execute the *same* kernel on disjoint chunks of an array at the same time. A
tiny helper reproduces exactly that: the input is split once into ``n``
contiguous chunks (cheap views, no copy) and the kernel is run on every chunk
from a :class:`~concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor`.

Two operators are compared because they sit at opposite ends of the
compute/memory spectrum:

* ``Abs`` is **memory-bandwidth bound** - it does almost no arithmetic per
  element, so a single thread already gets close to saturating the memory bus
  on small arrays.
* ``Exp`` is **compute bound** - it evaluates a polynomial per element, so the
  work parallelizes across cores more readily.

The take-away, visible in the plot below: threading only pays off for
**large** arrays. For small ones the thread-pool overhead dwarfs the kernel and
makes parallelism a net loss, and the compute-bound ``Exp`` starts benefiting at
a smaller array size than the memory-bound ``Abs``.

# A flat line at ``1`` marks "no gain from threads". Both operators dip below
# ``1`` for small arrays (thread overhead) and rise above it for large ones,
# with ``Exp`` crossing the break-even point earlier than ``Abs``.
