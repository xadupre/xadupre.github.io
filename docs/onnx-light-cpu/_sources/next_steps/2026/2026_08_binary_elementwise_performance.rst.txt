Binary Elementwise Performance Follow-up
=========================================

:Date: 2026-08
:Updated: 2026-09-08

**complete**

Objective
---------

The functional Binary roadmap is complete: all 19 registered operators share
one prepared broadcast engine, execute through the session-owned executor, and
have reproducible correctness and benchmark corpora. This follow-up addresses
the performance gaps exposed by the complete end-to-end benchmark rather than
adding more operator semantics.

The final gate is:

* at least ``1.0x`` ONNX Runtime median performance for every priority
  operator/type/loop-family group;
* no priority case below ``0.9x``;
* no small-tensor p90 regression greater than 2% against the current serial
  SIMD baseline;
* no private scheduler, inference-time tuning, or registry access in the hot
  path.

Measured baseline
-----------------

The first tuning pass removed the fixed four-participant ceiling, increased
executor granularity, and added typed bulk loops for integer and
half-precision ``Add``, ``Sub``, and ``Mul``. On the measured ``Sub`` corpus:

* median speed-up over ONNX Runtime increased from ``0.155x`` to ``1.533x``;
* median onnx-light-cpu execution time improved by ``3.0x``;
* the fraction of cases faster than ONNX Runtime increased from 6.0% to 51.8%;
* the median ``n=4096`` and ``n=65536`` cases reached ``2.36x`` and ``1.93x``;
* the median ``n=1048576`` and ``n=4194304`` cases remained at only ``0.39x``
  and ``0.56x``.

These numbers are diagnostic, not a final parity claim. They cover one
operator on one host, and ONNX Runtime timing dispersion was significant for
some large broadcast cases. The complete unfiltered corpus must be rerun with
raw samples, affinity, effective thread count, and selected tuning parameters
recorded before accepting any optimization.

FP32 fixed-exponent broadcast follow-up
----------------------------------------

The FP32 ``Pow`` scalar-exponent adapter already recognized exponents 2
through 5, but its per-element finite/underflow checks prevented the
repeated-multiplication loop from vectorizing. It now uses an AVX2
fixed-exponent loop with vector validity masks and scalar ``std::pow``
repair only for exceptional lanes. The multiplication order, signed zeros,
finite-boundary results, tails, and exact in-place operation match the
existing scalar adapter. Integer-typed exponents, fractional exponents,
and broadcast scheduling are unchanged.

Registered-runtime measurements on an Intel Xeon Platinum 8480C, with 96
configured threads and main ``1fc3359`` as the baseline, reduced the
1,048,576-element ``float32xfloat32`` per-channel case from 0.000204432 s
to 0.000097377 s (2.10x) and the swapped outer-broadcast case from
0.000206468 s to 0.000073306 s (2.82x). These are before/after gains, not
ONNX Runtime ratios. Routing through the general AVX-512 Pow kernel and a
two-pass scalar validity scan were both rejected after end-to-end
measurements showed no improvement.

.. code-block:: bash

   python -m onnx_light_cpu benchmark --dtype float32 --onnxruntime \
       --test '^test_cpu_pow_v15_(outer_float32xfloat32_to_float32_swapped|per_channel_float32xfloat32_to_float32)_n1048576_benchmark$' \
       --threads 96 -r 100 -w 30 -t 0.5 -o pow-broadcast.xlsx

Integer arithmetic and 64-bit comparisons
-----------------------------------------

Integer ``Pow`` uses exact checked integer multiplication, with a portable
fallback for compilers without overflow intrinsics. Typed contiguous and
scalar-broadcast adapters share the same overflow contract. Scalar exponents
0, 1, and 2 use fill, copy, and checked-square paths, including repeated
broadcast inner blocks.

Integer ``Div`` and both integer ``Mod`` modes prepare an unsigned reciprocal
once per scalar-divisor block. Quotients use multiply-high and an exact
remainder correction, or shifts for powers of two; signed results retain
truncation toward zero and Python-modulo sign correction. Short blocks retain
hardware division. Both operators validate unique divisors in bulk and retain
the signed-minimum divided by minus-one check before execution.

Signed and unsigned 64-bit comparisons have baseline, AVX2, and AVX-512F
implementations for contiguous and either scalar-broadcast input. AVX2 biases
the unsigned sign bit before signed comparison. Output bytes are canonical
booleans and short tails remain scalar.

The parity matrix includes integer ``Pow``/``Div``, ``Mod`` (including int16),
and all four ordered int64/uint64 comparisons across its seven broadcast
families. Integer outputs are compared exactly, rather than after conversion
to float32. Each integer benchmark requires a recorded implementation path;
the comparison ISA comes from runtime dispatch, not host CPU flags.
``used_kernel_paths(session)`` includes records such as
``Binary.Pow.integer_pow.scalar_exponent``,
``Binary.Mod.integer_divmod.invariant_divisor``, and
``Binary.Greater.compare64.avx2``. ``used_kernel_names`` still returns only
operator identities.

After updating the checkout and rebuilding, run a homogeneous campaign with
the existing runner (repeat with an AVX2-ceiling build on AVX-512 hosts):

.. code-block:: bash

   PYTHONPATH="$PWD" python tools/benchmark_binary_parity.py --no-calibrate \
       --case '^test_cpu_(pow|div|mod|greater|greaterorequal|less|lessorequal)_v[0-9]+_.*_(u?int16|u?int32|u?int64)x' \
       --threads 1 --threads physical --cpus 0-3 \
       -r 100 -w 30 --output /tmp/integer-binary-parity.json

The report retains raw alternating samples, shapes, types, effective threads,
implementation paths, and latency percentiles. ORT worker spinning is disabled
so idle workers cannot interfere with the other candidate. A filtered campaign
does not satisfy the runner's complete-matrix gate; inspect its per-case
``speedup`` values against 0.9 and retain profiles for remaining exceptions.
Integer Mod benchmark fixtures use the released opset-13 schema, whose integer
semantics are unchanged in Mod-28. Correctness fixtures retain the latest opset.

2026-09-17 diagnostic campaign
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Revision ``1991b23`` was measured on an AMD EPYC 9V74 VM with two physical
cores, affinity ``0-3``, GCC Release/AUTO dispatch, onnx-light 0.1.27, and ORT
1.30.0. The 420 comparable rows cover 65,536 and 1,048,576 output elements,
all seven families, and one/two configured threads. Recording confirmed the
integer arithmetic adapters and AVX-512 comparison kernels. There were no
unsupported cases. Median speedup was **2.017x**, but **44 rows remained below
0.9x**: this is not a completed parity gate or a dedicated-machine result.
The longer four-size campaign was stopped without publishing partial results.

.. code-block:: bash

   PYTHONPATH="$PWD" python tools/benchmark_binary_parity.py --no-calibrate \
       --case '^test_cpu_(pow|div|mod)_v[0-9]+_.*_int(16|32|64)x.*_n(65536|1048576)_benchmark$' \
       --case '^test_cpu_(greater|greaterorequal|less|lessorequal)_v[0-9]+_.*_(int64|uint64)x.*_n(65536|1048576)_benchmark$' \
       --threads 1 --threads physical --cpus 0-3 \
       -r 30 -w 10 -t 0.05 --output /tmp/integer-binary-final.json

Each row below summarizes 28 measurements; ratios are ORT/CPU median latency.

Exception profiles and follow-up:

* All int32 Div families remain below target. Non-scalar divisors still use
  hardware division. Disassembly of the invariant-divisor adapter confirms
  multiply/shift execution, but only baseline SSE2 compiler vectorization,
  including reciprocal work alongside the power-of-two shift path. Dedicated
  wider integer-division loops remain necessary.
* Int64 Div exceptions are the 1,048,576-element left-scalar case with one
  thread; contiguous/left-scalar at that size with two threads; and every
  65,536-element family except right-scalar with two threads. The default
  block-size policy can keep these small workloads serial despite two
  configured threads.
* Mod exceptions are contiguous and left-scalar at 1,048,576 elements with one
  thread, for each of int16/int32/int64. These retain the divisor scan and
  hardware remainder loop, unlike the optimized invariant-divisor path.
* The remaining Pow exception is int64 per-channel, 65,536 elements, two
  configured threads: CPU 0.000375912 s versus ORT 0.0002072725 s. It lies at
  the default scheduling-granularity boundary. At 1,048,576 elements the same
  family reaches 0.933x with two threads and 0.998x with one.
* The first campaign exposed repeated CPUID in checked-square dispatch.
  Caching it reduced one-thread int64 per-channel latency at 1,048,576
  elements from 0.031368454 s to 0.005959802 s. This comparison is diagnostic:
  the independently profiled 65,536-element case improved from 0.001325910 s
  to 0.000379798 s.

Call-level profiles used ``python -m cProfile -o /tmp/integer.pstats`` before
the runner command, selecting the four cases below at 65,536 elements, one
thread, ``-r 100 -w 30 -t 0.2``. Of 0.074665 s in 524 CPU wrapper calls,
0.074490 s was in the native-backed evaluator call; case collection consumed
0.672408 s outside the timed region. These profiles locate the remaining
cost below the Python wrapper, not within case generation. Native PMU
profiling was unavailable because the runner has ``perf_event_paranoid=4``;
instruction-level hotspot attribution remains unverified.

Current execution and tuning contract
-------------------------------------

Every worker combines both levels of parallelism: ``ExecuteRanges`` assigns an
independent output range to a session worker, and that worker invokes the bulk
SIMD loop for its range. Small inputs remain serial SIMD to avoid executor
overhead.

Binary kernels now register tuning ABI 2 under exact operator and left-input
element-type keys with ``library="onnx_light_cpu"`` and
``implementation="broadcast_plan"``. The immutable per-session parameters are:

* ``parallel.bulk_threshold_bytes`` (portable default: 1 MiB);
* ``parallel.block_threshold_bytes`` (portable default: 1 MiB);
* ``parallel.scalar_threshold_bytes`` (portable default: 256 KiB);
* ``parallel.target_block_bytes`` (portable default: 1 MiB).
* ``parallel.max_participants`` (portable default: 0, meaning the complete
  effective session executor).

The registry validates and resolves these parameters before execution. The hot
path reads only the configured typed values; it performs no registry lookup,
string lookup, allocation, or lock. The participant ceiling is applied to both
flat and multidimensional schedules.

A targeted 1,176-case pass covering ``Add``, ``Sub``, ``Mul``, ``Div``,
``Mod``, ``Pow``, ``PRelu``, ``Equal``, ``Less``, ``And`` and
``BitwiseAnd`` improved the aggregate median from ``0.394x`` to ``0.669x``
ONNX Runtime. The fraction below parity fell from 50.8% to 37.5%.
Comparison and bitwise median gains in onnx-light-cpu time were ``3.0x`` to
``4.4x``. These figures remain diagnostic: repeated large arithmetic runs
show enough host dispersion that they do not satisfy the final gate.

The latest arithmetic follow-ups are `#563
<https://github.com/xadupre/onnx-light-cpu/pull/563>`_ and `#577
<https://github.com/xadupre/onnx-light-cpu/pull/577>`_. #563 unrolls AVX-512
FP32/FP64 arithmetic, adds the missing FP32 ``PRelu`` vector paths, and extends
the backend benchmark coverage. #577 validates the physical integer divisor
tensor once, inspecting expanded broadcast pairs only for the signed
``INT_MIN / -1`` overflow case.

Remaining bottlenecks
---------------------

True low-precision SIMD
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

FP16/BF16 ``Add``, ``Sub``, ``Mul``, ``Div`` and ``PRelu`` now widen and
narrow vectorized blocks through the shared half-conversion kernels for
contiguous and scalar-broadcast loops. ``Mod`` and ``Pow`` use the same
block-conversion approach for contiguous loops. Add dedicated
AVX-512FP16, AVX-512BF16 where applicable, F16C/AVX2 conversion-vector, NEON
FP16, and SVE/SVE2 implementations. Unsupported instruction sets must retain
the portable bulk loop.

Integer and predicate bulk coverage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``Div``, ``Mod``, comparisons, logical operators, bitwise operators, shifts,
and integer ``PRelu`` now have typed contiguous and scalar-broadcast loops for
every same-type signature. Comparisons emit canonical byte ``BOOL``.
Integer ``Div``/``Mod`` and ``BitShift`` validate the complete input first and
then enter unchecked typed compute loops. The remaining work in this area is
ISA-specific predicate packing and validation bulk loops; validation still
uses the prepared strided traversal.

Expensive arithmetic
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

FP32 ``Pow`` now stays in FP32 rather than promoting every operation to
``long double``, and float/integer mixed signatures have typed bulk loops.
On AVX-512, exponents 0 through 5 use exact multiplications, positive finite
bases with finite exponents use the shared vector ``Log``/``Exp`` primitives,
and exceptional values fall back to ``std::pow``. Contiguous and left-scalar
loops have dedicated vector paths; small repeated blocks avoid the large-loop
dispatch overhead. The approximation is checked against ``std::pow`` with a
``3e-5`` relative tolerance.

At 4,194,304 FP32 elements on the development host, all measured contiguous,
scalar, row, per-channel, outer, and general-strided orientations reached
parity with ONNX Runtime. The narrowest result was the row broadcast at
``1.03x``; the other broadcast families reached ``1.21x`` to ``2.85x``, scalar
cases ``3.81x`` to ``4.17x``, and contiguous ``2.56x``.

General broadcast traversal
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Contiguous, scalar, repeated-block, and vector-inner families can call bulk
loops. Rank 2-4 prepared plans now use fixed-size traversal state. They seed offsets
once per worker range, avoid heap allocation in workers, and dispatch their
typed inner bulk loop without the arbitrary-rank counter. The generic
strided traversal remains the correctness fallback for higher ranks and for
adapters without a compatible inner bulk loop.

On the targeted 116-case ``general`` corpus, median onnx-light-cpu time for
``n=1048576`` fell from 2.28 ms to 0.31 ms and ``n=4194304`` from 2.43 ms to
0.36 ms. Small cases were retained (3.83 to 3.64 us at ``n=4096``). ONNX
Runtime timings varied substantially on the largest group, so these are
implementation-time comparisons rather than parity claims.

Do not add an unbounded template matrix for arbitrary ranks. Retain the
current prepared general loop as the correctness fallback and specialize only
patterns demonstrated by the backend corpus and real models.

Executor granularity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The fixed four-worker cap hid dispatch overhead but prevented large tensors
from scaling. Removing it improved large inputs only after each submitted
range was increased to roughly 1 MiB of useful traffic. One portable block
size is still unlikely to fit every processor, data type, and operation.

Calibration must jointly search crossover and block size. It should measure
candidate thresholds ``0``, 64 KiB, 256 KiB, 1 MiB, 4 MiB and 16 MiB, while
the executor derives participant count from useful blocks and the session
limit. Record the actual participant count after SIMD/cache-line alignment;
the requested count alone is not sufficient evidence.

Runtime and allocation overhead
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Measure both a preallocated ``BinaryBroadcastPlan::Execute`` layer and the
complete ``ReferenceEvaluator`` path. If the preallocated kernel reaches
parity but end-to-end execution does not, profile output allocation, tensor
metadata construction, plan-cache access, and runtime dispatch separately.
Do not compensate for runtime allocation overhead by over-parallelizing the
compute loop.

Calibration and persistence
---------------------------

Deterministic calibration callbacks are registered for every Binary tuning
key. Each callback jointly evaluates seven complete profiles spanning serial,
coarse, balanced, fine-grained, compute-heavy and participant-limited
schedules in addition to the portable profile. Calibration uses equal-shape,
scalar-broadcast and prepared rank-4 cases and:

* creates deterministic inputs and caller-preallocated outputs;
* compares every candidate byte-for-byte against forced-serial output;
* records repeated samples and scores candidates relative to serial execution;
* jointly selects all four byte parameters and the participant ceiling;
* rejects profiles that regress small-tensor p90 by more than 2%;
* obeys explicit duration and cumulative live-memory limits;
* publishes atomically through onnx-light's execution-specific registry.

Portable defaults remain available when no exact processor profile exists.
Existing sessions retain their resolved immutable configuration when a later
calibration publishes a new generation. Python and CLI inspection must show
the exact key, source profile, four configured byte values, participant
ceiling, and effective session thread count.

Benchmark and acceptance matrix
-------------------------------

The benchmark matrix crosses:

* all 19 operators and every manifest signature;
* contiguous, left/right scalar, row, per-channel, outer, and general
  broadcasts, including swapped non-commutative operands;
* output sizes 4,096, 65,536, 1,048,576, and 4,194,304;
* session limits 1, 2, 4, physical cores, and logical cores;
* portable scalar, available SIMD levels, portable tuning defaults, and exact
  calibrated profiles.

Published comparisons use ONNX Runtime's normal CPU execution provider. The
tool publishes in-memory calibrated Binary profiles before creating benchmark
sessions and records those calibration reports with the backend case name,
operator, complete type signature, loop family, shapes, byte traffic model,
SIMD level, affinity, warmups, raw samples, median, dispersion, and correctness
tolerance. ONNX Runtime CPU signatures that are not implemented, currently the
priority BF16 arithmetic and PRelu cases on the measured build, are reported as
not comparable rather than silently dropped or substituted with FP32.

The final implementation pass also replaced callback-per-element bulk loops
for logical operators and FP32 PRelu with direct vectorizable/SIMD loops.
FP32 Pow scalar exponents 0 through 5 use multiplication/copy/fill kernels
instead of libm. At 65,536 elements on the development host this improved:

* logical And by 4.1x to 12.5x in onnx-light-cpu time, reaching 1.46x to 2.62x
  ONNX Runtime across the measured families;
* the previously slow PRelu families by about 5x, while the explicit FP32 SIMD
  contiguous and scalar paths reached 4.5x to 5.5x ONNX Runtime;
* Pow right-scalar by 33x to 35x and integer-valued per-channel exponents to
  about 9.75x ONNX Runtime.

A complete 1,008-cell development-host pass found all comparable matrix cells
and classified 280 BF16 cells as unsupported by ONNX Runtime CPU. Its aggregate
median was 1.41x and every operator/type/loop-family group except contiguous
FP32 Div (0.983x) reached a 1.0x median. The run did not pass the per-case or
small-p90 gates: the shared 96-core host showed severe large-case executor
dispersion. These results are diagnostic and do not replace the required
pinned dedicated-machine acceptance run.
