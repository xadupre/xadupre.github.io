Available Kernels
=================

The table below lists the kernels **provided by this repository**
(``onnx-light-cpu``). It does not include the kernels that come with onnx-light
itself. The list is generated automatically at documentation build time by
scanning this repository's public C++ header
(``onnx_light_cpu/cpu_kernels.h``), so it always reflects the kernels this
repository actually provides.

.. registered-kernels::

Each kernel implements an ONNX operator for the given element data type. The
``Abs`` kernels compute the elementwise absolute value and dispatch at runtime
to the best available instruction set (AVX-512, AVX2, AVX, SSE2, or a scalar
fallback), selected once through CPUID-based CPU feature detection.
