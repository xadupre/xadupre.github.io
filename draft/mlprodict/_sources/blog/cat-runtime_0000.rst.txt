    This example shows how to compute the predictions of a model
    using C#.

    I've been struggling to understand why the first implementation
    of TreeEnsemble could not get as fast as *scikit-learn* implementation
    for a RandomForest when the number of observations was 100.000 or above,
    100 trees and a depth >= 10. The only difference was that the computation
    was parallelized by trees and not by observations. These
    observations are benchmarked in
    :ref:`l-example-tree-ensemble-reg-bench`
    (:ref:`l-example-tree-ensemble-cls-bench-multi` for the
    multiclass version).

    I was recently investigating issue
    `onnxruntime/4130 <https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/issues/4130>`_
    in notebook :ref:`onnxdiscrepenciesrst`.
    While looking into a way to solve it, I finally discovered
    that this is not an easy problem.
