BatchNormalization - 7 vs 9
===========================

Next section compares an older to a newer version of the same operator 
after both definition are converted into markdown text.
Green means an addition to the newer version, red means a deletion.
Anything else is unchanged.

      Carries out batch normalization as described in the paper
      https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03167. Depending on the mode it is being run,
      there are multiple cases for the number of outputs, which we list below:
  
      Output case #1: Y, mean, var, saved_mean, saved_var (training mode)
      Output case #2: Y (test mode)
    + 
    + For previous (depreciated) non-spatial cases, implementors are suggested
    + to flatten the input shape to (N x C*D1*D2 ..*Dn) before a BatchNormalization Op.
    -     This operator has **optional** inputs/outputs. See ONNX &amp;lt;https://github.com/onnx/onnx/blob/master/docs/IR.md&amp;gt;_ for more details about the representation of optional arguments. An empty string may be used in the place of an actual argument&amp;#39;s name to indicate a missing argument. Trailing optional arguments (those not followed by an argument that is present) may also be simply omitted.

      **Attributes**
  
      * **epsilon**:
        The epsilon value to use to avoid division by zero.
      * **momentum**:
        Factor used in computing the running mean and variance.e.g.,
        running_mean = running_mean * momentum + mean * (1 - momentum).
    - * **spatial**:
    -   If true, compute the mean and variance across per activation. If
    -   false, compute the mean and variance across per feature over each
    -   mini-batch.
  
      **Inputs**
  
      * **X** (heterogeneous) - **T**:
    -   Input data tensor from the previous operator; dimensions for image

    -   case are (N x C x H x W), where N is the batch size, C is the number
    -   of channels, and H and W are the height and the width of the data.
    -   For non image case, the dimensions are in the form of (N x C x D1 x
    -   D2 ... Dn), where N is the batch size.
    +   form of (N x C x D1 x D2 ... Dn), where N is the batch size, C is
    +   the number of channels. Statistics are computed for every channel of
    +   C over N and D1 to Dn dimensions. For image data, input dimensions
    +   become (N x C x H x W). The op also accepts single dimension input
    +   of size N in which case C is assumed to be 1
      * **scale** (heterogeneous) - **T**:
    +   Scale tensor of shape (C).
    -   If spatial is true, the dimension of scale is (C). If spatial is
    -   false, the dimensions of scale are (C x D1 x ... x Dn)
      * **B** (heterogeneous) - **T**:
    +   Bias tensor of shape (C).
    -   If spatial is true, the dimension of bias is (C). If spatial is
    -   false, the dimensions of bias are (C x D1 x ... x Dn)
      * **mean** (heterogeneous) - **T**:
    +   running (training) or estimated (testing) mean tensor of shape (C).
    -   If spatial is true, the dimension of the running mean (training) or
    -   the estimated mean (testing) is (C). If spatial is false, the
    -   dimensions of the running mean (training) or the estimated mean
    -   (testing) are (C x D1 x ... x Dn).
      * **var** (heterogeneous) - **T**:
    +   running (training) or estimated (testing) variance tensor of shape
    +   (C).
    -   If spatial is true, the dimension of the running variance(training)
    -   or the estimated variance (testing) is (C). If spatial is false, the
    -   dimensions of the running variance(training) or the estimated
    -   variance (testing) are (C x D1 x ... x Dn).
  
      **Outputs**
  
      Between 1 and 5 outputs.
  
      * **Y** (heterogeneous) - **T**:
        The output tensor of the same shape as X
      * **mean** (optional, heterogeneous) - **T**:
        The running mean after the BatchNormalization operator.
      * **var** (optional, heterogeneous) - **T**:
        The running variance after the BatchNormalization operator.
      * **saved_mean** (optional, heterogeneous) - **T**:
        Saved mean used during training to speed up gradient computation.
      * **saved_var** (optional, heterogeneous) - **T**:
        Saved variance used during training to speed up gradient
        computation.
  
      **Type Constraints**
  
      * **T** in (
        tensor(double),
        tensor(float),
        tensor(float16)
        ):
        Constrain input and output types to float tensors.
