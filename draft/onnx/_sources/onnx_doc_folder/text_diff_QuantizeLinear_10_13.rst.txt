QuantizeLinear - 10 vs 13
=========================

Next section compares an older to a newer version of the same operator 
after both definition are converted into markdown text.
Green means an addition to the newer version, red means a deletion.
Anything else is unchanged.

    - The quantization formula is y = saturate ((x / y_scale) + y_zero_point). For saturation, it saturates to [0, 255] if it's uint8, or [-128, 127] if it's int8.
    + The scale factor and zero point must have same shape, and can be either a scalar for per-tensor / per layer quantization, or a 1-D tensor for per-axis quantization.
    + The quantization formula is y = saturate ((x / y_scale) + y_zero_point).
    + For saturation, it saturates to [0, 255] if it's uint8, or [-128, 127] if it's int8.
      For (x / y_scale), it's rounding to nearest ties to even. Refer to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rounding for details. 'y_zero_point' and 'y' must have same type.

    + **Attributes**
    + 
    + * **axis**:
    +   (Optional) The axis of the quantization dimension of the input
    +   tensor. Ignored for per-tensor quantization. Negative value means
    +   counting dimensions from the back. Accepted range is [-r, r-1] where
    +   r = rank(input).
  
      **Inputs**
  
      Between 2 and 3 inputs.
  
      * **x** (heterogeneous) - **T1**:
        N-D full precision Input tensor to be quantized.
      * **y_scale** (heterogeneous) - **tensor(float)**:
    -   Scale for doing quantization to get 'y'. It's a scalar, which means

    -   a per-tensor/layer quantization.
    +   means per-tensor/layer quantization, or a 1-D Tensor for per-axis
    +   quantization.
      * **y_zero_point** (optional, heterogeneous) - **T2**:
    -   Zero point for doing quantization to get 'y'. It's a scalar, which

    -   means a per-tensor/layer quantization. Default value is uint8 typed
    -   0 if it's not specified.
    +   y_scale. Default is uint8 with zero point of 0 if it's not
    +   specified.
  
      **Outputs**
  
      * **y** (heterogeneous) - **T2**:
        N-D quantized output tensor. It has same shape as input 'x'.
  
      **Type Constraints**
  
      * **T1** in (
        tensor(float),
        tensor(int32)
        ):
        Constrain 'x' to float or int32 tensor.
      * **T2** in (
        tensor(int8),
        tensor(uint8)
        ):
        Constrain 'y_zero_point' and 'y' to 8-bit integer tensor.
