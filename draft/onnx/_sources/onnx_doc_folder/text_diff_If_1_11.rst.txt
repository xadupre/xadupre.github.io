If - 1 vs 11
============

Next section compares an older to a newer version of the same operator 
after both definition are converted into markdown text.
Green means an addition to the newer version, red means a deletion.
Anything else is unchanged.

      **Attributes**
  
      * **else_branch** (required):
        Graph to run if condition is false. Has N outputs: values you wish
        to be live-out to the enclosing scope. The number of outputs must
        match the number of outputs in the then_branch.
      * **then_branch** (required):
        Graph to run if condition is true. Has N outputs: values you wish to
        be live-out to the enclosing scope. The number of outputs must match
        the number of outputs in the else_branch.
  
      **Inputs**
  
      * **cond** (heterogeneous) - **B**:
        Condition for the if
  
      **Outputs**
  
      Between 1 and 2147483647 outputs.
  
      * **outputs** (variadic) - **V**:
        Values that are live-out to the enclosing scope. The return values
    -   in the then_branch and else_branch must be of the same data

    +   same data type.
    -   type. The then_branch and else_branch may produce tensors with
    -   the same element type and different shapes. If corresponding outputs
    -   from the then-branch and the else-branch have static shapes S1 and
    -   S2, then the shape of the corresponding output variable of the if-
    -   node (if present) must be compatible with both S1 and S2 as it
    -   represents the union of both possible shapes.For example, if in a
    -   model file, the first output of then_branch is typed float tensor
    -   with shape [2] and the first output of else_branch is another
    -   float tensor with shape [3], If's first output should have (a) no
    -   shape set, or (b) a shape of rank 1 with neither dim_value nor
    -   dim_param set, or (c) a shape of rank 1 with a unique dim_param.
    -   In contrast, the first output cannot have the shape [2] since [2]
    -   and [3] are not compatible.
