Cast - 6 vs 9
=============

Next section compares an older to a newer version of the same operator 
after both definition are converted into markdown text.
Green means an addition to the newer version, red means a deletion.
Anything else is unchanged.

      The operator casts the elements of a given input tensor to a data type
      specified by the &amp;#39;to&amp;#39; argument and returns an output tensor of the same size in
      the converted type. The &amp;#39;to&amp;#39; argument must be one of the data types specified
      in the &amp;#39;DataType&amp;#39; enum field in the TensorProto message.
    - NOTE: Casting to and from strings is not supported yet.
    + 
    + Casting from string tensor in plain (e.g., &amp;#34;3.14&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;1000&amp;#34;) and scientific numeric representations
    + (e.g., &amp;#34;1e-5&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;1E8&amp;#34;) to float types is supported. For example, converting string &amp;#34;100.5&amp;#34; to an integer may
    + result 100. There are some string literals reserved for special floating-point values;
    + &amp;#34;+INF&amp;#34; (and &amp;#34;INF&amp;#34;), &amp;#34;-INF&amp;#34;, and &amp;#34;NaN&amp;#34; are positive infinity, negative infinity, and not-a-number, respectively.
    + Any string which can exactly match &amp;#34;+INF&amp;#34; in a case-insensitive way would be mapped to positive infinite. Similarly,
    + this case-insensitive rule is applied to &amp;#34;INF&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;NaN&amp;#34;. When casting from numeric tensors
    + to string tensors, plain floating-point representation (such as &amp;#34;314.15926&amp;#34;) would be used.
    + Converting non-numerical-literal string such as &amp;#34;Hello World!&amp;#34; is an undefined behavior. Cases
    + of converting string representing floating-point arithmetic value, such as &amp;#34;2.718&amp;#34;, to INT is an undefined behavior.
    + 
    + Conversion from a numerical type to any numerical type is always allowed.
    + User must be aware of precision loss and value change caused by range difference between two types.
    + For example, a 64-bit float 3.1415926459 may be round to a 32-bit float 3.141592. Similarly, converting
    + an integer 36 to Boolean may produce 1 because we truncate bits which can&amp;#39;t be stored in the targeted type.
  
      **Attributes**
  
      * **to** (required):
        The data type to which the elements of the input tensor are cast.
        Strictly must be one of the types from DataType enum in TensorProto
  
      **Inputs**
  
      * **input** (heterogeneous) - **T1**:
        Input tensor to be cast.
  
      **Outputs**
  
      * **output** (heterogeneous) - **T2**:
        Output tensor with the same shape as input with type specified by
        the &amp;#39;to&amp;#39; argument
