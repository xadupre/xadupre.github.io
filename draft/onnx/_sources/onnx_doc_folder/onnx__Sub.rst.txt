Sub - 6
=======

**Version**

* **name**: `Sub (GitHub) <https://github.com/onnx/onnx/blob/main/docs/Operators.md#Sub>`_
* **domain**: **main**
* **since_version**: **6**
* **function**: False
* **support_level**: SupportType.COMMON
* **shape inference**: True

This version of the operator has been available
**since version 6**.

**Summary**

Performs element-wise binary subtraction (with limited broadcast support).

If necessary the right-hand-side argument will be broadcasted to match the
shape of left-hand-side argument. When broadcasting is specified, the second
tensor can either be of element size 1 (including a scalar tensor and any
tensor with rank equal to or smaller than the first tensor), or having its
shape as a contiguous subset of the first tensor's shape. The starting of the
mutually equal shape is specified by the argument "axis", and if it is not set,
suffix matching is assumed. 1-dim expansion doesn't work yet.

For example, the following tensor shapes are supported (with broadcast=1):

  shape(A) = (2, 3, 4, 5), shape(B) = (,), i.e. B is a scalar tensor
  shape(A) = (2, 3, 4, 5), shape(B) = (1, 1), i.e. B is an 1-element tensor
  shape(A) = (2, 3, 4, 5), shape(B) = (5,)
  shape(A) = (2, 3, 4, 5), shape(B) = (4, 5)
  shape(A) = (2, 3, 4, 5), shape(B) = (3, 4), with axis=1
  shape(A) = (2, 3, 4, 5), shape(B) = (2), with axis=0

Attribute `broadcast=1` needs to be passed to enable broadcasting.

**Attributes**

* **axis**:
  If set, defines the broadcast dimensions. See doc for details.
* **broadcast**:
  Pass 1 to enable broadcasting

**Inputs**

* **A** (heterogeneous) - **T**:
  First operand, should share the type with the second operand.
* **B** (heterogeneous) - **T**:
  Second operand. With broadcasting can be of smaller size than A. If
  broadcasting is disabled it should be of the same size.

**Outputs**

* **C** (heterogeneous) - **T**:
  Result, has same dimensions and type as A

**Type Constraints**

* **T** in (
  tensor(double),
  tensor(float),
  tensor(float16),
  tensor(int32),
  tensor(int64),
  tensor(uint32),
  tensor(uint64)
  ):
  Constrain input and output types to high-precision numeric tensors.
