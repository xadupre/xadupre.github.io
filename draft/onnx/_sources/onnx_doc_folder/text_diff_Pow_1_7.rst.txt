Pow - 1 vs 7
============

Next section compares an older to a newer version of the same operator 
after both definition are converted into markdown text.
Green means an addition to the newer version, red means a deletion.
Anything else is unchanged.

      Pow takes input data (Tensor&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;) and exponent Tensor, and
      produces one output data (Tensor&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;) where the function f(x) = x^exponent,
      is applied to the data tensor elementwise.
    + This operator supports **multidirectional (i.e., Numpy-style) broadcasting**; for more details please check Broadcasting in ONNX &amp;lt;https://github.com/onnx/onnx/blob/master/docs/Broadcasting.md&amp;gt;_.
    - 
    - If necessary the right-hand-side argument will be broadcasted to match the
    - shape of left-hand-side argument. When broadcasting is specified, the second
    - tensor can either be of element size 1 (including a scalar tensor and any
    - tensor with rank equal to or smaller than the first tensor), or having its
    - shape as a contiguous subset of the first tensor&amp;#39;s shape. The starting of the
    - mutually equal shape is specified by the argument &amp;#34;axis&amp;#34;, and if it is not set,
    - suffix matching is assumed. 1-dim expansion doesn&amp;#39;t work yet.
    - 
    - For example, the following tensor shapes are supported (with broadcast=1):
    - 
    -   shape(A) = (2, 3, 4, 5), shape(B) = (,), i.e. B is a scalar tensor
    -   shape(A) = (2, 3, 4, 5), shape(B) = (1, 1), i.e. B is an 1-element tensor
    -   shape(A) = (2, 3, 4, 5), shape(B) = (5,)
    -   shape(A) = (2, 3, 4, 5), shape(B) = (4, 5)
    -   shape(A) = (2, 3, 4, 5), shape(B) = (3, 4), with axis=1
    -   shape(A) = (2, 3, 4, 5), shape(B) = (2), with axis=0
    - 
    - Attribute broadcast=1 needs to be passed to enable broadcasting.
    - 
    - **Attributes**
    - 
    - * **axis**:
    -   If set, defines the broadcast dimensions. See doc for details.
    - * **broadcast**:
    -   Pass 1 to enable broadcasting
  
      **Inputs**
  
      * **X** (heterogeneous) - **T**:
    -   Input tensor of any shape, base of the exponent.
    +   First operand, base of the exponent.
      * **Y** (heterogeneous) - **T**:
    +   Second operand, power of the exponent.
    -   Input tensor of any shape broadcastable to X shape, the exponent
    -   component.
  
      **Outputs**
  
      * **Z** (heterogeneous) - **T**:
    -   Output tensor (same size as X)
    +   Output tensor.
  
      **Type Constraints**
  
      * **T** in (
        tensor(double),
        tensor(float),
        tensor(float16)
        ):
        Constrain input and output types to float tensors.
