LpPool - 11
===========

**Version**

* **name**: `LpPool (GitHub) <https://github.com/onnx/onnx/blob/main/docs/Operators.md#LpPool>`_
* **domain**: **main**
* **since_version**: **11**
* **function**: False
* **support_level**: SupportType.COMMON
* **shape inference**: True

This version of the operator has been available
**since version 11**.

**Summary**

LpPool consumes an input tensor X and applies Lp pooling across
the tensor according to kernel sizes, stride sizes, and pad lengths.
Lp pooling consisting of computing the Lp norm on all values of a subset
of the input tensor according to the kernel size and downsampling the
data into the output tensor Y for further processing.

**Attributes**

* **auto_pad**:
  auto_pad must be either NOTSET, SAME_UPPER, SAME_LOWER or VALID.
  Where default value is NOTSET, which means explicit padding is used.
  SAME_UPPER or SAME_LOWER mean pad the input so that `output_shape[i]
  = ceil(input_shape[i] / strides[i])` for each axis `i`. The padding
  is split between the two sides equally or almost equally (depending
  on whether it is even or odd). In case the padding is an odd number,
  the extra padding is added at the end for SAME_UPPER and at the
  beginning for SAME_LOWER.
* **kernel_shape** (required):
  The size of the kernel along each axis.
* **p**:
  p value of the Lp norm used to pool over the input data.
* **pads**:
  Padding for the beginning and ending along each spatial axis, it can
  take any value greater than or equal to 0. The value represent the
  number of pixels added to the beginning and end part of the
  corresponding axis. `pads` format should be as follow [x1_begin,
  x2_begin...x1_end, x2_end,...], where xi_begin the number of pixels
  added at the beginning of axis `i` and xi_end, the number of pixels
  added at the end of axis `i`. This attribute cannot be used
  simultaneously with auto_pad attribute. If not present, the padding
  defaults to 0 along start and end of each spatial axis.
* **strides**:
  Stride along each spatial axis. If not present, the stride defaults
  to 1 along each spatial axis.

**Inputs**

* **X** (heterogeneous) - **T**:
  Input data tensor from the previous operator; dimensions for image
  case are (N x C x H x W), where N is the batch size, C is the number
  of channels, and H and W are the height and the width of the data.
  For non image case, the dimensions are in the form of (N x C x D1 x
  D2 ... Dn), where N is the batch size.

**Outputs**

* **Y** (heterogeneous) - **T**:
  Output data tensor from Lp pooling across the input tensor.
  Dimensions will vary based on various kernel, stride, and pad sizes.

**Type Constraints**

* **T** in (
  tensor(double),
  tensor(float),
  tensor(float16)
  ):
  Constrain input and output types to float tensors.
