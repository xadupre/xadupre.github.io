BatchNormalization - 1 vs 6
===========================

Next section compares an older to a newer version of the same operator 
after both definition are converted into markdown text.
Green means an addition to the newer version, red means a deletion.
Anything else is unchanged.

      Carries out batch normalization as described in the paper
      https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03167. Depending on the mode it is being run,
      there are multiple cases for the number of outputs, which we list below:
  
      Output case #1: Y, mean, var, saved_mean, saved_var (training mode)
      Output case #2: Y (test mode)
  
      **Attributes**
  
    + * **consumed_inputs** (required):
    +   legacy optimization attribute.
      * **epsilon**:
        The epsilon value to use to avoid division by zero, default is
        1e-5f.
      * **is_test**:
        If set to nonzero, run spatial batch normalization in test mode,
        default is 0.
      * **momentum**:
        Factor used in computing the running mean and variance.e.g.,
        running_mean = running_mean * momentum + mean * (1 - momentum),
        default is 0.9f.
      * **spatial**:
        If true, compute the mean and variance across all spatial elements
        If false, compute the mean and variance across per feature.Default
        is 1.
  
      **Inputs**
  
      * **X** (heterogeneous) - **T**:
    +   The input 4-dimensional tensor of shape NCHW.
    -   Input data tensor from the previous operator; dimensions for image
    -   case are (N x C x H x W), where N is the batch size, C is the number
    -   of channels, and H and W are the height and the width of the data.
    -   For non image case, the dimensions are in the form of (N x C x D1 x
    -   D2 ... Dn), where N is the batch size.
      * **scale** (heterogeneous) - **T**:
        The scale as a 1-dimensional tensor of size C to be applied to the
        output.
      * **B** (heterogeneous) - **T**:
        The bias as a 1-dimensional tensor of size C to be applied to the
        output.
      * **mean** (heterogeneous) - **T**:
        The running mean (training) or the estimated mean (testing) as a
        1-dimensional tensor of size C.
      * **var** (heterogeneous) - **T**:
        The running variance (training) or the estimated variance (testing)
        as a 1-dimensional tensor of size C.
  
      **Outputs**
  
      Between 1 and 5 outputs.
  
      * **Y** (heterogeneous) - **T**:
    -   The output tensor of the same shape as X.
    +   The output 4-dimensional tensor of the same shape as X.
    ?             ++++++++++++++
      * **mean** (optional, heterogeneous) - **T**:
        The running mean after the BatchNormalization operator. Must be in-
        place with the input mean. Should not be used for testing.
      * **var** (optional, heterogeneous) - **T**:
        The running variance after the BatchNormalization operator. Must be
        in-place with the input var. Should not be used for testing.
      * **saved_mean** (optional, heterogeneous) - **T**:
        Saved mean used during training to speed up gradient computation.
        Should not be used for testing.
      * **saved_var** (optional, heterogeneous) - **T**:
        Saved variance used during training to speed up gradient
        computation. Should not be used for testing.
  
      **Type Constraints**
  
      * **T** in (
        tensor(double),
        tensor(float),
        tensor(float16)
        ):
        Constrain input and output types to float tensors.
