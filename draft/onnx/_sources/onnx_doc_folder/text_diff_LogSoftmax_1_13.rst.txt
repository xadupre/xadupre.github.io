LogSoftmax - 1 vs 13
====================

Next section compares an older to a newer version of the same operator 
after both definition are converted into markdown text.
Green means an addition to the newer version, red means a deletion.
Anything else is unchanged.

    - The operator computes the log of softmax values for the given input:
    + The operator computes the logsoftmax (log of softmax) values for each layer in the batch
    +  of the given input. The input is a 2-D tensor (Tensor<float>) of size
    + (batch_size x input_feature_dimensions). The output tensor has the same shape
    + and contains the logsoftmax values of the corresponding input.
  
    -  LogSoftmax(input, axis) = Log(Softmax(input, axis=axis))
    - 
    - The "axis" attribute indicates the dimension along which LogSoftmax
    - will be performed. The output tensor has the same shape
    - and contains the LogSoftmax values of the corresponding input.
    + Input does not need to explicitly be a 2D vector; rather, it will be
    + coerced into one. For an arbitrary n-dimensional tensor
    + input \in [a_0, a_1, ..., a_{k-1}, a_k, ..., a_{n-1}] and k is
    + the axis provided, then input will be coerced into a 2-dimensional tensor with
    + dimensions [a_0 * ... * a_{k-1}, a_k * ... * a_{n-1}]. For the default
    + case where axis=1, this means the input tensor will be coerced into a 2D tensor
    + of dimensions [a_0, a_1 * ... * a_{n-1}], where a_0 is often the batch size.
    + In this situation, we must have a_0 = N and a_1 * ... * a_{n-1} = D.
    + Each of these dimensions must be matched correctly, or else the operator
    + will throw errors.
  
      **Attributes**
  
      * **axis**:
    +   Describes the axis of the inputs when coerced to 2D; defaults to one
    +   because the 0th axis most likely describes the batch_size
    -    Describes the dimension LogSoftmax will be performed on. Negative
    -   value means counting dimensions from the back. Accepted range is
    -   [-r, r-1] where r = rank(input).
  
      **Inputs**
  
      * **input** (heterogeneous) - **T**:
    -   The input tensor of rank >= axis.
    +   The input tensor that's coerced into a 2D matrix of size (NxD) as
    +   described above.
  
      **Outputs**
  
      * **output** (heterogeneous) - **T**:
    -   The output values with the same shape as the input tensor.
