**Description**

Trains a tree ensemble, or loads it from a file, then maps a numeric feature vector to three outputs: 1. A vector containing the individual tree outputs of the tree ensemble. 2. A vector indicating the leaves that the feature vector falls on in the tree ensemble. 3. A vector indicating the paths that the feature vector falls on in the tree ensemble. If a both a model file and a trainer are specified - will use the model file. If neither are specified, will train a default FastTree model. This can handle key labels by training a regression model towards their optionally permuted indices.
