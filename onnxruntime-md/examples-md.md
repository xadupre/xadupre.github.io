# Gallery of examples



The first series of examples briefly goes into the main feature *ONNX Runtime* implements. Each of them run in a few seconds and relies on machine learned models trained with [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/).

Contents:

* [Load and predict with ONNX Runtime and a very simple model](auto-examples-plot-load-and-predict.md)
* [Common errors with onnxruntime](auto-examples-plot-common-errors.md)
* [Train, convert and predict with ONNX Runtime](auto-examples-plot-train-convert-predict.md)
* [Draw a pipeline](auto-examples-plot-pipeline.md)
* [ONNX Runtime Backend for ONNX](auto-examples-plot-backend.md)
* [Train, convert and predict with ONNX Runtime](auto-examples-plot-convert-pipeline-vectorizer.md)
* [Metadata](auto-examples-plot-metadata.md)
* [Profile the execution of a simple model](auto-examples-plot-profiling.md)




The second series is about deep learning. Once converted to *ONNX*, the predictions can be computed with *onnxruntime* without having any dependencies on the framework used to train the model.
